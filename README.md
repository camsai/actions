# Actions

Composite GitHub actions for CICD workflows. Meant to reduce the repetitive logic in code repositories by providing reusable functionality. 

Actions are organized by domain/purpose/action where domain is the programming language and purpose is the intent of the action. 

By default, actions take the name `action.yml`, hence the use of a directory structure to differentiate them.
